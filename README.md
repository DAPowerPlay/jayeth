# Jayeth

A highly experimental JSON RPC router/loadbalancer/aggregator server. Allows you to expose multiple JSON RPC services on one interface.

With Jayeth you can round-robin requests across multiple RPC servers, route requests per method, define a fallback server, or call a method on multiple server at the same time.

## But why?

While experimenting with JSON RPC ethereum clients, i found there are some things that seem nice to have:

* If my local ethereum node drops, automatically fallback RPC calls to Infura.
* Call specific RPC methods on specific ethereum clients (eg. automatically call parity_allTransactions on Parity node, clique_getSingers on Pantheon node without having to manage two different Web3.js instances)
* Possibility to loadbalance requests across multiple rpc nodes
* Call a RPC method on multiple nodes at the same time (helpful when comparing RPC responses on different ethereum client implementations)

Although my motivation for Jayeth came from using Ethereum JSON RPC, you can use it for any services exposing any JSON RPC interface.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

Install Jayeth:

```
npm install jayeth
```

or if you want to develop Jayeth locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/DAPowerPlay/jayeth
cd jayeth
npm install
npm test
```

Use it:

```
const Jayeth = require('jayeth')

const config = {
  // port where jayeth server will listen
  "port": 3001,
  // in this example, for every 20 requests, 5 will go to rpc_server_1, 5 will go to rpc_server_2, 10 will go to rpc_server_3, none will go to rpc_server_4
  "endpoints": {
    "rpc_server_1": {
      "server": "http://localhost:3012",
      "weight": 5
    },
    "rpc_server_2": {
      "server": "http://localhost:3013",
      "weight": 5
    },
    "rpc_server_3": {
      "server": "http://localhost:3014",
      "weight": 10
    },
    "rpc_server_4": {
      "server": "http://localhost:3015",
      "weight": -1
    }
  },
  // if a client requests "add" method, the request will be routed explicitly to rpc_server_3, "substract" method to rpc_server_4
  "methods": {
    "add": "rpc_server_3",
    "substract": "rpc_server_4"
  },
  // requests to the jayeth will be round-robined across endpoints defined in config.endpoints
  "default": "round-robin",
  // if an error is encountered , jayeth will attempt to call the endpoint defined in "fallback"
  "fallback" : "rpc_server_4"
}

const jayeth = new Jayeth(config)

jayeth.listen()

// jayeth server is now available on port 3001.
// See /test folder for more configuration examples

```

## Running the tests

Tests are written in Mocha. Test script will also run standard.js style guide, linter, and formatter.

### Running tests

```
npm test
```

If standard.js is complaining about code formmating/style you can try to run:

```
npm run fix
```

### Debug

jayeth is using the debug module, set DEBUG environment variable to see the logs:

```
export DEBUG=jayeth:*
```

## Deployment

This is a highly experimental module, please read the source before running this in production. Tested only with http:// transport.
